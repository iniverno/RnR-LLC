   Simics provides many ways to connect the simulated network to the real
   network. They are listed in the network chapter of <em>Simics User
   Guide</em>. For some of them a small helper program, <b>openif</b>,
   needs to be installed.  <b>openif</b> must run with super-user
   privileges. There are several ways of accomplishing this:
<p>
   <ul>
<p>
    <li> Install <b>openif</b> as setuid root. This usually the easiest
         way. In the simplest case, it is just a matter of running these shell
         commands, replacing <em>host</em> with the host type you are
         running Simics on, for example, x86-linux:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
# <b>cd [simics]</b>
# <b>chown root <em>host</em>/bin/openif</b>
# <b>chmod u+s <em>host</em>/bin/openif</b>
</pre>
<p>
         If the file system where Simics is installed does not allow setuid
         binaries, then it can be moved to some other location and either
         a symbolic link to the new location be made, or the Simics command
         <b>network-helper</b> be used to point out the new location.
<p>
         To verify that <b>openif</b> has been installed properly, try
         executing it directly from the shell as an ordinary user.
         If it complains about root privileges, it does not have the correct
         permission flags set and you may need to move it, perhaps to a
         directory on a local (not networked) file system.
<p>
         Since the <b>openif</b> program allows an unprivileged program
         to read and send raw packets from the network interface, you may
         want to restrict access to it. In this case, it can be put in a
         directory to which access is restricted using the standard Unix
         mechanisms. Its location then has to be indicated as above. </li>
<p>
    <li> If you have the common Unix utility <b>sudo</b> installed, it
         can be used to run <b>openif</b> from Simics by the means of
         a small wrapper script. This script would look like:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
#!/bin/sh
exec sudo /path/to/openif $*
</pre>
<p>
         Then use either a symbolic link or the <b>network-helper</b>
         command to tell Simics where to find the script. Note that
         <b>sudo</b> must be configured to allow the user to run <b>openif</b>
         as root, without giving a password.</li>
<p>
    <li> You can also run the entire Simics Central process as root.
         This alternative is not recommended, and may cause problems
         depending on the license model chosen.</li>
   </ul>
<p>
   The source code of <b>openif</b> is available as part of the Simics
   distribution, open to inspection and modification as needed.
<p>
   Note that allowing unprivileged users to access the raw network device
   may cause security problems. Therefore it is not recommended to use
   the real-network connection in an untrusted network environment. A safer
   solution is to use the port forwarding feature in Simics instead.
