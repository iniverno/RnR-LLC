<h2 class="jdocu">1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About Simics Documentation</h2 class="jdocu">


<p>


<a name="label2"></a><h3 class="jdocu">1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conventions</h3 class="jdocu">


       <p>
Let us take a quick look at the conventions used throughout the Simics
documentation. Scripts, screen dumps and code fragments are presented in a
<tt>monospace</tt> font. In screen dumps, user input is always presented in
bold font, as in:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
Welcome to the Simics prompt
simics&gt; <b>this is something that you should type</b>
</pre>
<p>
Sometimes, artificial line breaks may be introduced to prevent the text from
being too wide. When such a break occurs, it is indicated by a small arrow
pointing down, showing that the interrupted text continues on the next line:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
This is an artificial <img src="nextline.png">
line break that shouldn't be there.
</pre>

<a name="label4"></a>
<p>
The directory where Simics is installed is referred to as
<tt>[simics]</tt>, for example when mentioning the
<tt>[simics]/README</tt> file. In the same way, the shortcut
<tt>[workspace]</tt> is used to point at the user's workspace directory.
<p>

<a name="label5"></a><h3 class="jdocu">1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simics Guides and Manuals</h3 class="jdocu">


<p>
Simics comes with several guides and manuals, which will be briefly described
here. All documentation can be found in <tt>[simics]/doc</tt> as Windows
Help files (on Windows), HTML files (on Unix) and PDF files (on both
platforms). The new Eclipse-based interface also includes Simics documentation
in its own help system.
<p>
<a name="label6"></a><h4 class="jdocu">Simics Installation Guide for Unix and for Windows</h4 class="jdocu">

  
<p>
  These guides describe how to install Simics and provide a short description
  of an installed Simics package. They also cover the additional steps needed
  for certain features of Simics to work (connection to real network, building
  new Simics modules, ...).
<p>

<a name="label7"></a><h4 class="jdocu">Simics User Guide for Unix and for Windows</h4 class="jdocu">

  
<p>
  These guides focus on getting a new user up to speed with Simics, providing
  information on Simics features such as debugging, profiling, networks,
  machine configuration and scripting.
<p>

<a name="label8"></a><h4 class="jdocu">Simics Eclipse User Guide</h4 class="jdocu">

  
<p>
  This is an alternative User Guide describing Simics and its new Eclipse-based
  graphical user interface.
<p>

<a name="label9"></a><h4 class="jdocu">Simics Target Guides</h4 class="jdocu">

   
<p>
  These guides provide more specific information on the different architectures
  simulated by Simics and the example machines that are provided. They explain
  how the machine configurations are built and how they can be changed, as well
  as how to install new operating systems. They also list potential limitations
  of the models.
<p>

<a name="label10"></a><h4 class="jdocu">Simics Programming Guide</h4 class="jdocu">

  
<p>
  This guide explains how to extend Simics by creating new devices and new
  commands. It gives a broad overview of how to work with modules and how to
  develop new classes and objects that fit in the Simics environment. It is
  only available when the DML add-on package has been installed.
<p>

<a name="label11"></a><h4 class="jdocu">DML Tutorial</h4 class="jdocu">

  
<p>
  This tutorial will give you a gentle and practical introduction to the Device
  Modeling Language (DML), guiding you through the creation of a simple
  device. It is only available when the DML add-on package has been installed.
<p>

<a name="label12"></a><h4 class="jdocu">DML Reference Manual</h4 class="jdocu">

  
<p>
  This manual provides a complete reference of DML used for developing new
  devices with Simics. It is only available when the DML add-on package has
  been installed.
<p>

<a name="label13"></a><h4 class="jdocu">Simics Reference Manual</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
  This manual provides complete information on all commands, modules, classes
  and haps implemented by Simics as well as the functions and data types
  defined in the Simics API.
<p>

<a name="label14"></a><h4 class="jdocu">Simics Micro-Architectural Interface</h4 class="jdocu">

  
<p>
  This guide describes the cycle-accurate extensions of Simics
  (Micro-Architecture Interface or MAI) and provides information on how to
  write your own processor timing models. It is only available when the DML
  add-on package has been installed.
<p>

<a name="label15"></a><h4 class="jdocu">RELEASENOTES and LIMITATIONS files</h4 class="jdocu">

   
<p>
  These files are located in Simics's main directory (i.e.,
  <tt>[simics]</tt>). They list limitations, changes and improvements on a
  per-version basis. They are the best source of information on new
  functionalities and specific bug fixes.
