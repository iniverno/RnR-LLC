<a name="label373"></a><h3 class="jdocu">5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notes on Solaris for Fiesta</h3 class="jdocu">


<p>
<ul>
<p>
<li>
For information about system administration of Solaris, see the
<a class="jdocu" href="http://docs.sun.com" target="_top">http://docs.sun.com</a> web site.
</li>
<p>
<li>Remember to boot with the <tt>-r</tt> flag after changing a machine
configuration. Example:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>system_cmp0.set-prom-env boot-command "boot disk1 -rv"</b>
</pre>
</li>
<p>
<li>
Booting from a disk in a different location that it was setup for is not
recommended. It is possible, but requires some knowledge of Solaris
administration.
</li>
<p>
<li>
When using multiple Ethernet adapters in a Serengeti system, all will be
assigned the same system-wide MAC address by Solaris. To avoid this, the OBP
variable <tt>local-mac-address?</tt> can be set to <tt>true</tt>. Setting this
variable from the Simics command-line is done using the following command:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>system_cmp0.set-prom-env local-mac-address? true</b>
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<a name="label374"></a><h3 class="jdocu">5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multiple Network Devices</h3 class="jdocu">



By default, only the first network device is connected to a simulated network
when running with <tt>$create_network</tt> set to <tt>yes</tt>. To run with
multiple network devices, the <b>&lt;device&gt;.connect</b> command should be
used to connect each additional device to the Ethernet link. If several
network devices have the same MAC address (default unless the
<tt>local-mac-address?</tt>  OBP variable is set) they must be connected to
different simulated links.

<a name="label376"></a> 
<a name="label377"></a>
<a name="label378"></a>
<p>
The clock frequency of a simulated processor can be set arbitrarily in
Simics.  This will not affect the actual speed of simulation, but it
will affect the number of instructions that need to be executed for a
certain amount of simulated time to pass.  If your execution only
depends on executing a certain number of instructions, increasing the clock frequency will take
the same amount of host time (but a shorter amount of target
time). However, if there are time based delays of some kind in the simulation,
these will take  longer to execute. 
<p>
At a simulated 1 MHz, one million target instructions will correspond to a
simulated second (assuming the simple default timing of one cycle per
instruction). At 100 MHz, on the other hand, it will take 100 million
target instructions to complete a simulated second. So with a higher clock
frequency, less simulated target time is going to pass for a certain
period of host execution time.
<p>
If Simics is used to emulate an interactive system (especially one
with a graphical user interface) it is a good idea to set the clock
frequency quite low.  Keyboard and mouse inputs events are handled by
periodic interrupts in most operating systems, using a higher clock
frequency will result in longer delays between invocations of periodic
interrupts.  Thus, the simulated system will feel slower in its user
response, and update the mouse cursor position etc. less frequently.
If this is a problem, the best technique for running experiments at a
high clock frequency is to first complete the configuration of the
machine using a low clock frequency.  Save all configuration changes
to a disk diff (like when installing operating systems).  Then change
the configuration to use a higher a clock frequency and reboot the
target machine.
<p>
Note that for a lightly-loaded machine (for example, working at an
interactive prompt on a serial console to an embedded Linux system),
Simics will often execute quickly enough at the real target clock
frequency that there is no need to artifically lower it.
